A final project made by three people:

William Holley -  wjholley@ucdavis.edu

Guanzhi Wang - agwang@ucdavis.edu

Luc-Tanton Tran - lqtran@ucdavis.edu

A project that analyzes some data about birds getting malaria.

Who knew birds could get malaria? Not the authors, before we found these data.

Enjoy, or whatever

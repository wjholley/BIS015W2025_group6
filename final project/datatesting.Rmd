## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
tf_ps <- read_csv("data/landscapegenetics/genomics_tf_ps.csv")
```
```{r}
tf_ps %>% 
      group_by(malaria, distpoul_cat) %>% 
      summarize(n=n(), .groups = 'keep') %>%
      group_by(distpoul_cat) %>% 
      mutate(perc = 100*n/sum(n)) %>%
      filter(malaria == "Y") %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = distpoul_cat, y = perc))+
      geom_col()
```
```{r}
names(tf_ps)
```
